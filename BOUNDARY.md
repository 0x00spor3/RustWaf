This document is normative: no feature may remain ambiguous. Every entry is labeled
`OPEN`, `ENTERPRISE`, or `SPLIT` (with the cut line made explicit). Retroactively
changing an already-released boundary is forbidden (see §Boundary stability policy).

---

## 1. OPEN SOURCE (community) — Apache-2.0 license

The complete datapath and everything needed to protect a single node.

### 1.1 Datapath and orchestration
- Listener and standalone **reverse proxy**.
- **Phased pipeline** (`on_connection` → `on_request_line` → `on_headers` → `on_body` → `on_response`).
- `WafModule` module contract and the `Decision` type (Allow / Block / Monitor / Score / Scores / Reject).
- `RequestContext` and score accumulation.

### 1.2 Normalization and canonicalization
- `canonicalize_value` (conditional percent-decode, NFKC, pipeline-wide overlong-collapse).
- Derived `decode-then-match-then-discard` channel (base64, HTML-entity, tag/control-strip, VBScript-concat).
- Multipart coverage (`name` / `filename` / `value`), JSON leaf canonicalization, cookie normalization.

### 1.3 Detection modules (all of them)
- SQLi, XSS, Path Traversal, RCE/Cmd-Injection, LFI/RFI, SSRF, Header Injection,
  Request Smuggling, SSI/XXE.
- **gRPC and GraphQL inspection** → see §3.1 (these are datapath, they stay OPEN).

### 1.4 Scoring and tuning
- Cumulative CRS-style anomaly scoring, configurable severities (config **C2**).
- **Paranoia levels** 1–4.
- Equivalence fast-path (`RegexSet` prefilter).

### 1.5 State and rate limiting (single-node)
- **In-process L7 rate limiting** (token bucket).
- **`StateStore`** trait + **in-memory** implementation (`InMemoryStateStore`, in `waf-core`). *(This is the extension point onto which enterprise multi-node plugs in.)*

### 1.6 Single-node operability
- External TOML config, semantic validation, per-scenario fail-open/closed (`[resilience]`).
- Hot reload via **SIGHUP** (validate-then-swap).
- **Trusted-proxy IP resolution** (`trusted_proxies`, `client_ip_header`, `trusted_hops`).
- Structured **JSON logging**; **baseline OpenTelemetry/Prometheus** export.

### 1.7 Quality and validation
- `waf-corpus` (versioned malicious/benign corpus) and test suites.
- Extensibility: **WASM plugin runtime (Proxy-Wasm)**. **IMPLEMENTED (B3)**: a `wasmi`-based
  runtime (`waf-wasm` crate) loads a `.wasm` Proxy-Wasm filter as a `WafModule` (`[modules.wasm]`,
  default off; implemented host-function subset + dynamic stubs for the rest, fuel/memory DoS
  caps, instance pool, fail-closed — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` §9). The *runtime* is OPEN;
  *marketplace/signing* stays enterprise (§2.4).
- **Parser** for importing OWASP CRS / ModSecurity rules. **IMPLEMENTED (B2)**: a `seclang`
  parser + subset evaluator runs imported `SecRule` files as a `WafModule` (`[modules.crs]`,
  default off; supported subset + boot skip-report — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` §9). The *parser/engine*
  is OPEN; the *curated rule content* stays enterprise (§2.4).

---

## 2. ENTERPRISE (paid) — source-available license (BSL 1.1 / Elastic 2.0)

Scale, governance, compliance, and team operability.

### 2.1 Distributed multi-node state
- **Distributed `StateStore`** implementation (Redis/shared store): cluster-wide rate-limit and IP-reputation.

### 2.2 Control plane
- Web dashboard, rule management, blocked-request drill-down, alerting.
- **Pre-built dashboards + long-term retention** of metrics/telemetry.

### 2.3 Governance and compliance
- **RBAC**, SSO/SAML/OIDC, signed audit logs (SOC2 / PCI-DSS).
- Automated compliance reports, long-term retention.

### 2.4 Threat intelligence and curated content
- **Premium reputation/signature feed** by subscription.
- **Curated premium CRS/ModSecurity rules** (the *parser* stays OPEN, §1.7).
- WASM plugin **marketplace/signing** (the *runtime* stays OPEN, §1.7).

### 2.5 Integration and support
- Enterprise SIEM connectors, SLA support, guided hardening.

## 3. Explicitly decided cases

### 3.1 gRPC and GraphQL → `OPEN`
These are **datapath parsing/inspection surfaces**, like multipart or JSON: they are
*detection* capabilities, not *scale*. Keeping them out of the core would yield a WAF
unable to inspect modern traffic (a "gutted core") and would push into closed-source
exactly the part that requires inspectable trust. Argument/variable injection flows
through `canonicalize_value` + the derived channel + scoring (§1.4) like any other
inspected field; the **structural** GraphQL protections run as a structural module
(see below), outside the content prefilter.
> **GraphQL — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 11), `OPEN`.** The core ships the **structural caps** — query
> depth (paren-aware), alias/field/directive counts, batch size, and an introspection policy —
> as a `structural()` `Phase::Body` module (`[modules.graphql]`, default off).
>
> **gRPC — IMPLEMENTED (gRPC phase, over Phase-12 HTTP/2), `OPEN`.** The core de-frames the gRPC
> body and extracts the protobuf fields into the §6 derived channel (so a SQLi/XSS in a field is
> caught by the content modules), plus a `structural()` `grpc` module with message-size / field-count
> / nesting-depth caps and a compressed-payload policy (`[modules.grpc]`, default off). Content
> extraction is best-effort (schema-less wire format); the structural caps are the guaranteed signal.
> Forwarding is h2c end-to-end with trailer relay (unary; streaming + h2-over-TLS backend deferred).
>
> *Associated enterprise value* (for both): premium GraphQL/gRPC signatures (curated depth/complexity
> abuse), **managed schema-enforcement** (validating against the app's real schema/`.proto` = schema
> management/governance), dashboard drill-down → §2.

### 3.2 HTTPS / TLS → `SPLIT`
- **Basic TLS termination** (accepting `https://`, cert from file) → `OPEN`, for
  single-node self-sufficiency. **IMPLEMENTED (Phase 12)**: rustls cert-from-file on the
  listener, ALPN-negotiated h1/h2 via the `auto` builder, behind the `TlsCertSource` seam
  (`waf-proxy::tls`); config `[tls]`, default off. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §9.
- **Certificate management at scale** (automatic ACME/Let's Encrypt, rotation,
  centralized multi-node certs, **mTLS with managed PKI**) → `ENTERPRISE`
  (governance/scale). These plug in as enterprise implementations of the **same**
  `TlsCertSource` trait — the §4 pattern (the core ships only `FileCertSource`).

### 3.3 Gray zone (cut-line summary)

| Feature | OPEN | ENTERPRISE |
|---|---|---|
| WASM plugins (Proxy-Wasm) | runtime ✅ (B3) | marketplace / signing |
| OpenTelemetry / Prometheus | baseline export | pre-built dashboards + retention |
| OWASP CRS / ModSecurity rules | parser ✅ (B2) | curated premium rules |
| TLS | basic termination | ACME / mTLS PKI / multi-node |

## 4. Boundary architectural pattern

For every enterprise feature, the core defines the **trait** (extension point);
the enterprise provides the **at-scale implementation**.

```rust
// in waf-core (OPEN) — A0 decision (2026-06-24): a single ATOMIC operation, not a
// get/update pair. Refill-then-consume must be indivisible across callers, else two
// nodes read the same bucket level and both allow (cluster-wide over-allow / TOCTOU).
// In-memory enforces it under one lock; a Redis impl uses one server-side script.
// Time and memory-bounding are the store's concern (in-memory owns a clock + a
// tracked-key cap; Redis uses server time + TTL), so they stay out of the ABI.
pub struct BucketParams { pub capacity: f64, pub refill_per_sec: f64 }
pub struct Acquired { pub allowed: bool, pub tokens_remaining: f64 }

pub trait StateStore: Send + Sync {
    fn try_acquire(&self, key: &str, cost: f64, params: BucketParams) -> Acquired;
}
// in-memory impl -> OPEN        (InMemoryStateStore)
// Redis impl      -> ENTERPRISE (waf-state-redis)
```

Future cluster-wide state (e.g. IP-reputation, §2.1) is added as a new trait method
with a default impl (non-breaking), not a separate get/update KV.

The impl is **injected without forking** through the stable embedding builder
(A2, 2026-06-24) — every seam has a default, so an empty builder equals `Proxy::bind`:

```rust
// enterprise crate, depending on the published core as a LIBRARY:
let proxy = Proxy::builder(&config)
    .state_store(Arc::new(RedisStore::connect(&url)?)) // ENTERPRISE impl of StateStore
    .cert_source(Arc::new(AcmeCertSource::new(..)))     // ENTERPRISE impl of TlsCertSource
    .modules(premium_modules)                          // extra WafModule set
    .build()
    .await?;
```

---

## 5. Boundary stability policy

The `WafModule`, `StateStore` and `TlsCertSource` traits are **public ABI**: SemVer,
frozen before the first public release.

**Config evolution (A4, 2026-06-24).** `Config` is `#[non_exhaustive]`: adding a future
top-level section (as `tls` was added) is **non-breaking** — external code cannot use a
`Config { .. }` literal, it builds from `Config::default()`/TOML and mutates, so a new
field is absorbed. This protects the whole config tree transitively, *except* the
sub-configs ALSO taken by-value by a public fn (`TlsConfig` → `acceptor_from_*`,
`NetworkConfig` → `ClientIpResolver::from_config`, `LimitsConfig` → `Normalizer::new`),
which are marked `#[non_exhaustive]` individually. The remaining sub-configs stay
literal-constructible (reached only through `config.field`). Marking a struct
`#[non_exhaustive]` later is itself breaking, so this set is part of the freeze.

A feature labeled `OPEN` **cannot** be moved to `ENTERPRISE` retroactively after a
release. The only permitted move is `ENTERPRISE → OPEN`.

Every new feature must be added to this file **before merge**, with an unambiguous label.

## 6. Licensing & contribution governance

> Engineering policy, not legal advice — the CLA text and trademark filings must be
> validated with counsel. The *decisions* below are fixed; the wording is not.

### 6.1 Core license = **Apache-2.0** (decided)
- **Chosen over MIT** for the explicit **patent grant + retaliation clause** (§3) —
  material for a security product — and the explicit **trademark exclusion** (§6),
  which opens the code without opening the name (see §6.3).
- **NOT AGPL / SSPL / BSL on the core.** Cloud-hostility lives in the **enterprise tier**
  (§2, BSL/Elastic), never in the datapath. A copyleft/source-available core would tax
  community adoption (enterprise legal teams routinely ban AGPL) and contradict the
  guiding rule (*inspectable, widely-adopted datapath*). The moat is the enterprise tier,
  not the core license — do not pay the adoption tax twice.

### 6.2 Contributor agreement — **REQUIRED before the first external contribution**
- Open-core depends on the ability to **dual-license** (sell commercial exceptions) and
  to relicense. Without inbound rights, a **single** external contributor can permanently
  block relicensing of the touched code.
- **Decision:** a **CLA** granting the project the right to license contributions under
  *both* the open license **and** the enterprise license; **DCO** (`Signed-off-by`) is the
  hard minimum. Must be wired into CI (bot check) **before** the first external PR is merged.
- **Document:** the agreement lives in [`CLA.md`](CLA.md) (Individual CLA, modeled on the
  Apache ICLA + the dual-licensing grant). A Corporate CLA is required when a company
  contributes on behalf of its employees (§4 of `CLA.md`).

### 6.3 Trademark = the real moat of a permissive core
- The permissive license opens the **code**, not the **name**. Register the project/product
  **name + logo**.
- **Policy:** *"fork it, but you cannot call it X, nor offer a service as X."* This is what
  a permissive open-core relies on for brand defense (Apache-2.0 §6 leaves it intact by design).

### 6.4 Per-crate hygiene (makes the §4 boundary physical, not just documentary)
- **SPDX header** in every source file; root `LICENSE` = Apache-2.0; a `NOTICE` file for
  third-party attribution (Apache-2.0 §4).
- **Enterprise crates** (`waf-state-redis`, control-plane, …) live in a **separate
  path/repo**, each carrying its own **BSL** `LICENSE` — so the cut line of §4 is enforced
  by file layout, not only by this document.
