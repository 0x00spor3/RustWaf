//! Fase 9 / DEC 1 — microbench of the **isolated inspection path** (`enqueue→verdetto`).
//!
//! This is the number that depends ONLY on our code: the cost of running the content
//! modules over an already-built, already-normalized context, with no upstream and no
//! network in the path. The connection phase + normalization are done ONCE up front
//! (via [`prepared_ctx`]); the timed routine is purely `run_inspection_gated`. The only
//! per-iteration setup is resetting `score`/`score_contributions` (a couple of ns), the
//! same in-place reset `examples/fastpath_bench.rs` uses — `RequestContext` is not
//! `Clone`, and a clone would dwarf the inspection it is meant to measure.
//!
//! **Worst-case payload, not the mean** (DEC 2): the PL3 ladder-binding corpus case
//! `lfi-rfi-remote-script-query`, which fires `rfi-remote-script` (Warning) AND overlaps
//! `rfi-remote-url` (Notice) — the most-accumulated-rules case from P2's score
//! distribution (ARCHITECTURE §7). Benching the worst case, not a clean/average request.
//!
//! **Instrument check (the bench-analog of the bite-test):** the reported time must land
//! in the ns-to-sub-µs regime consistent with `fastpath_bench.rs` (full-path inspection
//! was ~1520 ns @ C2/PL3). If this comes back in tens of µs, the harness is accidentally
//! timing setup/alloc, not inspection — the number would be measuring the wrong thing.
//!
//! On-demand, NOT a CI gate (DEC 4): `cargo bench -p waf-corpus`. The absolute `<1ms p99`
//! is declared on pinned hardware from this artifact; CI guards regressions relatively.
//!
//! **Pinned baseline (DEC 4 regression reference):** ~4.3 µs worst-case PL3 (Fase 10a;
//! was ~2 µs at Fase 9, ~2.65 µs after 10a-B1 — the growth is the per-request RegexSets
//! of the new content modules + the path scan added to rce/header_injection, ARCHITECTURE
//! §11 Fase 10a). This is the versioned reference the relative-regression gate compares
//! against — NOT an absolute assertion. **Headroom (DEC 1):** ~4.3 µs worst-case vs the
//! p99 1 ms contract ≈ 230× margin; the number depends only on our code, isolated from
//! upstream/network.
