//! Validation corpus for the WAF (Fase 7 / Pilastro 1).
//!
//! A single, versioned, reproducible set of cases — malicious (must trigger) and
//! benign (must not), including the known false-positive traps — run against the
//! **real** pipeline (`run_connection` → `normalize` → `run_inspection`). Detection
//! is frozen: the corpus *measures* what exists, it does not change rules.
//!
//! This crate is a library on purpose: the same corpus becomes the evidence base
//! for Pilastro 2 (threshold tuning, via the per-case score) and the equivalence
//! oracle for Pilastro 3 (fast-path).
//!
//! Design invariants (see [`runner`]):
//! - **fresh context per case** — every case starts from `score = 0` and a new
//!   `RequestContext`; no state is shared between cases;
//! - **rate-limit neutralized** — the pipeline is built without the rate limiter
//!   so a shared `client_ip` across sequential cases never yields a spurious 429;
//! - **paranoia is a runner parameter** — baseline [`runner::BASELINE_PARANOIA`]
//!   (worst case), but Pilastro 2 can re-run at other levels.

// ── Fase 7 / Pilastro 2: recommended scoring config (C2) ───────────────────────
//
// CRS weights with **Critical raised 5 → 6** so a single high-confidence rule
// blocks with own-merit margin ≥ 1 (the robustness CRS-default 5/T5 lacks), while
// weak signals stay sub-threshold so they only block in accumulation (anti-FP, see
// ARCHITECTURE §7 and the rfi-remote-url FP-prone rationale). Chosen over CRS-pure
// (C0), threshold-lowering (C1 → 2×Notice would block, mass FP in production) and a
// wide rescale (C3 → drops Warning+Notice accumulation, lowers blocking recall) on
// the corpus evidence. The sweep verified C2 has the SAME blocking set as C0 with
// benign-blocking 0 at every PL. Validated by `tests/validation.rs`.
